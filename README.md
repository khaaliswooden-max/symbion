SYMBION™ 🧬
Ingestible Gut-Brain Computer Interface
Universal Health Solutions for All Humanity

🌍 Mission
Symbion democratizes advanced medical diagnostics by providing continuous gut-brain axis monitoring through an affordable, non-invasive ingestible sensor. Our mission: compress global health disparities and enable preventive care for 4+ billion people in low- and middle-income countries.
🎯 What is Symbion?
Symbion is the world's first ingestible gut-brain computer interface designed from first principles to:

Monitor Root Causes: Track chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and gut-brain axis disruption—the fundamental drivers of dozens of chronic diseases
Enable Early Detection: Catch inflammatory bowel disease, depression, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions before they become irreversible
Ensure Global Access: Engineered for <$5/unit cost at scale with infrastructure independence for LMIC deployment

🧪 Scientific Foundation
Symbion addresses three root causes that drive multiple diseases simultaneously:

Chronic Inflammation: Links to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration—gut is primary source via intestinal permeability and microbiome dysbiosis
Metabolic Dysfunction: Gut-derived metabolites regulate glucose homeostasis; early detection enables pre-diabetic intervention
Gut-Brain Axis Disruption: 90% of serotonin, 50% of dopamine produced in gut; dysregulation drives depression, anxiety, Parkinson's, autism

Key Biomarkers Measured

Neurotransmitters: Serotonin, dopamine, GABA
Inflammatory: Calprotectin analogs, pH shifts, temperature
Metabolic: Glucose, short-chain fatty acids
Barrier Integrity: Permeability markers, pH gradients

🌟 Vision

"When a subsistence farmer in rural India has access to gut-brain diagnostics rivaling what's available at Mayo Clinic. When we detect inflammatory bowel disease in Kinshasa as early as we do in Copenhagen. When mental health conditions rooted in gut-brain dysfunction are caught in their prodrome, not after years of suffering. That is when we will have truly opened the door to solving disease for all humanity."
